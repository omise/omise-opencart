#### Frequent Problems

Permissions must be set so that **omise-opencart** can overwrite the following files:
- `your-opencart(root)/index.php`
- `your-opencart(root)/admin/index.php`
- `your-opencart(root)/omise-opencart`

It also creates new folders and files on your `your-opencart(root)/` directory for the first installation.  
Ensure these 2 files and folder have appropriate `write` permissions (usually `755`).

## Omise Keys Setup
In order to use **omise-opencart** you have to link it to your *Omise account* using your credentials:

1. Go to `Omise` > `Settings` (from Omise menu on the top right of the page)  
![Omise Menu](https://omise-cdn.s3.amazonaws.com/assets/omise-opencart/v2.x/setup1.png)

2. The page that opens allows you to save your `Omise Keys`. If you want to test Omise service integration, you can enable *test mode* by clicking `Enable test mode`. Your OpenCart will then process orders with your test keys.

## Uninstalling Omise

Because we can not automatically check that `vQmod` library is used by other extensions, we require you to manually remove Omise Payment Gateway from your server source code. Follow the next steps:

- Uninstall extension via extension list page of OpenCart
- Remove vQmod folder from your OpenCart directory

#### 1. Uninstall Omise Payment Gateway extension
1. Open your **OpenCart website**, then go to `/admin` page  

2. Go to `Extensions` > `Payments` (from the left menu)  
![Payments menu](https://omise-cdn.s3.amazonaws.com/assets/omise-opencart/v2.x/installation4-uninstall2.png )
 
3. Look for `Omise Payment Gateway` row and click **Uninstall**  
![Uninstall Omise Payment Gateway extension menu](https://omise-cdn.s3.amazonaws.com/assets/omise-opencart/v2.x/uninstall3.png)

Once uninstalled, `Omise` will not appear in the top right menu of your admin page anymore.

#### 2. Removed vQmod library
*For this step, please make sure you are not using `vQmod` library in other extensions. If you are unsure, you can leave it there. It will not have any effect on your site.

1. In your OpenCart directory you will see the `vqmod` folder. Remove it  
![vQmod folder](https://omise-cdn.s3.amazonaws.com/assets/omise-opencart/omise-opencart-install-14.png)  

2. Go to `omise-opencart/backup`, restore the backup files. You will see them here:  
![Backup folder](https://omise-cdn.s3.amazonaws.com/assets/omise-opencart/omise-opencart-install-15.png)  
Copy and past them into your OpenCart site  
  - `omise-opencart/backup/index.php` to `your-opencart(root)/index.php`  
  - `omise-opencart/backup/admin/index.php` to `your-opencart(root)/admin/index.php`
